        <p>Since this first assignment was fairly strightforward, I did not have many struggles
            completing the assignment. I did have trouble visualising the html that I was writing
            but I found a nice extension on VS Code that shows me a preview which I will be using
            often. I had an idea of the basics of html even before I took the course but this 
            assignment did help me learn the syntax. The resources that I used the most were
            the lecture notes which I got from the class website. I used the notes as a reference
            when I forgot specific syntax elements.
